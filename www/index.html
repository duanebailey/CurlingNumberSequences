<h3>New Results Concerning Curling Number Sequences</h3>
<i> Duane A. Bailey, Derrick Bonafilia '17, Tong Liu '16, Riwaz Poudyal '18, Adly Templeton, Diwas Timilsina '16</i>
<p>
The curling number of an finite sequence of integers indicates, essentially,
the maximum number of times a repeated suffix repeats. For example, the curl
of 
<br>
<center>S=[2,3,2,2,2,3,2,3]</center>
<br> is 2 since the suffix [2,3] is repeated twice
as a suffix. By iteratively expanding the sequence by appending 
its curling number we generate a (possibly infinite) sequence that at 
some point mentions 1.  The <i>tail</i> of the above sequence is the 58-digit
<br>
<center>S<sup>e</sup>=[2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,1].</center>
<br>  Indeed, S is the unique 8-digit string that yields a tail this long.
<p>
The <i>Curling Number Conjecture</i> suggests this process always eventually
mentions 1 or that the tails are always finite length.
<p>
This page organizes the public results (papers, programs, data) on our study of the conjecture as
it relates to the sequences composed primarily of 2's and 3's (we refer to these
as (2,3)-sequences).

<h4>A Quasi-crystalline Model for Curling (Bailey, Poudyal, Templeton, Liu and Timilsina)</h4>
We have developed a model for the growth of tails that makes builds a careful
analogy between (2,3)-sequences and the words of a parallel rewriting grammar (an D0L L-system or iterated morphism).  Approaching the Curling Number Conjecture
using a grammatical approach brings to bear important tools (viz. pumping-style
lemmas, population models, and others) that have yielded surprising and important results. 
<br> More of those results will appear here soon.

<h4>Enumeration of Rotten Sequences (Bailey, Bonafilia, Liu, Poudyal, Templeton)</h4>
In a computation that has taken about 196 CPU years, we have explored the
space of starting sequences to length 48.  Our enumeration of the <i>rotten</i>
sequences (sequences are rotten if, by prefixing the sequence with a digit
we <i>shorten</i> its tail), has more fine-grained understanding of the
structure of these rare sequences.  
<br>Information on that to be posted soon.

<h4>Enumeration of Active Sequences (Bailey and Poudyal)</h4>
We are beginning a similar enumeration of sequences that are <i>active</i>.
These are sequences who, when prefixed, have extended tails.  The importance
of these sequences has only recently been understood as important. 
<br> Information to be posted soon.

<h4>The Harmony Computation System (Bailey and Bonafilia)</h4>
Many of our calculations are based on python-orchestrated highly-tuned C code.
The coordination language, <i>harmony</i>, is a variant of Linda (by Gelernter et al.) that supports a distributed, checkpointed database that manages the
resources of volunteer workers.  Careful checkpointing was important to 
successfully weathering power and network outages, machine upgrades, and
hardware and human failures. 
<br> Notes with our experience using harmony to coordinate
machine labs, clusters, and hand-me-down hardware will be posted soon.
