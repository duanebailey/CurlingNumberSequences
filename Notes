Possible Conjecture:
For any sequence S, at least 2S or 3S has a tail length equal to that of S. i.e.
				t(S) = t(2S) or/and t(3S)

The prefix 2 or 3 may or may not be neutral, but the tails are always the same.

This was exhaustively verified for every sequence up to length 33 and all sequences with length 38

Path towards possible proof:

The conjecture holds by definition for trivial cases in which the added prefix is neutral.

Consider a sequence S such that t(S) = x, and t(2S) =\= x.
This means that adding a 2 in the front changes the tail of the sequence at some point by
completing a pattern that starts with a 2, that is, at some point the initial sequence and 
the tail can be written as

				A(2A)^K, 

where k>=1 and |A|>=0. A 2-prefix changes the sequence to (2A)^(k+1), thus changing 
the curl and the tail.

To prove the conjecture for these sequences, we need to prove that a 3-Prefix does not change
the sequences’s tail, that is 
				t(3A(2A)^k) = t(A(2A)^k)

Similarly, for a sequence Q for which t(S) =\= t(3S)

The pattern must be 
				A(3A)^K, 

where k>=2 (notice the change in lower bound of K) and 

				t(2A(3A)^k) = t(A(3A)^k)
The existence of this pattern were verified for each 2 or 3 rotten sequences of length <10
and some rotten sequences with length>10.


Proof: No doubly rotten sequence exist

Assume that the conjecture above is true. From the conjecture, for a X-rotten sequence S, 
				
					t(YS) = t(S), 
where X=2 if Y=3 and X=3 if Y=2

Hence, doubly rotten sequence do not exist. By the same logic, ‘doubly-active’ sequences, the opposite
of rotten sequences, also do not exist.
